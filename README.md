# datenight

I added the 'Granim.js' (Gradient Animation) up top, in order for that to work I had to change the 'DATE NIGHT' h2 tag and make it into a picture.

Also I had to add a few lines of code to both Wiley's and Adeel's code. The items on lines 10 & 11, clears the container before it runs the third button (Wine & Dine).

Also, the title for the meal and drink containers now show what category you chose.

So basically the project as is covers all our Phase 1 project requirements, after you guys agree with all the changes and merge it to the master brance of DateNight.

Tomorrow if I have time I will work on adding a dropdown so that it lists all the category options instead of typing it in.

Please review and let me know.

## Update 6 April 2020
Added new code to make the search fields into selectors, this required another network request.

Also added code where the unused category will return to default.

I will be doing the same to the drinks selection.

## Update 7 April 2020
Finished the remaining of features. Added new drop down selctors for the 'Drinks' section. Also added a scroll feature since alot of the meals and drinks sometimes list over 20 items.
